Basic Slideshow with Controls
=============================

Basic slideshow, no frameworks, fading with controls. You should be able to go click crazy on the next and previous buttons, with the slideshow paused or playing and things should not break.

You can [see the example][1] in action.

Modernizr is used for detecting Javascript, but I need to workout the what happens to the slideshow when there's it's not available.

I left all of my comments and notes to myself in the .coffee file. I find myself going back to earlier versions of this slideshow and building on top or modifiying. My goal here was to develop a nice base file that would help me learn more about using [Coffeescript][2].

js2Coffee.org was a big help for looking at my older version of plain Javascript and moving over to a Coffeescript version.
